What are the automorphism groups of the objects in Examples 1.1.2 and 1.1.3? Show that two isomorphic objects have isomorphic automorphism groups. (For readers with a topological background: if $X$ is a topological space, then the fundamental groupoid is the category where the objects are points of $X$, and the morphisms $x \\to y$ are paths from $x$ to $y$, up to homotopy. Then the automorphism group of $x_0$ is the (pointed) fundamental group $\\pi_1(X, x_0)$. In the case where $X$ is connected, and $\\pi_1(X)$ is not abelian, this illustrates the fact that for a connected groupoid — whose definition you can guess — the automorphism groups of the objects are all isomorphic, but not canonically isomorphic.)",
