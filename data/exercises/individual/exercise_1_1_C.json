  "content": "Let $(\\cdot)^{\\vee \\vee} \\colon f.d.Vec_{k} \\to f.d.Vec_{k}$ be the double dual functor from the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over $k$ to itself. Show that $(\\cdot)^{\\vee \\vee}$ is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor on $f.d.Vec_{k}$. (Without the finite-dimensionality hypothesis, we only get a natural transformation of functors from $\\operatorname{id}$ to $(\\cdot)^{\\vee \\vee}$.)\n\nLet $\\mathcal{V}$ be the category whose objects are the $k$-vector spaces $k^n$ for each $n \\geq 0$ (there is one vector space for each $n$), and whose morphisms are linear transformations. The objects of $\\mathcal{V}$ can be thought of as vector spaces with bases, and the morphisms as matrices. There is an obvious functor $\\mathcal{V} \\to f.d.Vec_k$, as each $k^n$ is a finite-dimensional vector space.",
