The point of this exercise is to give you some practice with categories, by relating them to an object you know well.)\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item[(a)] A perverse definition of a group is: a groupoid with one object. Make sense of this. (Similarly, in case you care: a perverse definition of a monoid is: a category with one object.)\n\\item[(b)] Describe a groupoid that is not a group.\n\\end{enumerate}",
