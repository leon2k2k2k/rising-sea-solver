(Recall that we are being cavalier about set-theoretic assumptions, see Caution 0.3.1, so feel free to simultaneously choose bases for each vector space in $f.d.Vec_k$. To make this precise, you will need to use Gödel-Bernays set theory or else replace $f.d.Vec_k$ with a very similar small category, but we won't worry about this.)",
